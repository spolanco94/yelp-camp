# YelpCamp

This is my collection of code files created as I followed along Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. 
Currently, I am now in the middle of refactoring the code and adding in additional UI Improvements to create what will 
ultimately become ShibaEats!

Covered throughout this lengthy project was an indepth exploration of MongoDB, Express, and Node.js (The MEN Stack) with a 
strong emphasis on the conventions of RESTful routing.
